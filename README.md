### 🎯 Overview  
This repository is a collection of **pure Python projects** built to strengthen my foundation in programming, data handling, and logic building.  
All projects are developed **without external libraries** — focusing only on **Python fundamentals** such as loops, conditionals, functions, OOP, and file handling.

> 💡 Each folder represents a different stage of my learning journey — from simple exercises to real-world problem-solving and mini analytical systems.
