### 🧠 Overview  
A **Python-based mini project** built to practice **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, **file handling**, and **error handling** by developing a fully functional **Student Data Management System**.  

This project simulates a small-scale academic management system for adding, tracking, and managing students, courses, and grades — designed to strengthen **core Python fundamentals** while demonstrating real-world problem-solving.

### 🚀 Features  

✅ Add Students (Undergraduate & Graduate)  
✅ Add Courses  
✅ Enroll Students in Courses  
✅ Assign Grades & Marks  
✅ Generate Student Report Cards  
✅ Show All Students (Undergrad & Graduate separately)  
✅ Show All Courses  
✅ Show All Enrollments (Master Roster)  
✅ Input Validation & Error Handling  
✅ File Handling with CSV for persistent storage

### 🧰 Concepts Practiced  

#### 🧩 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Classes & Objects:** `Person`, `Student`, and `GraduateStudent`  
- **Inheritance:** GraduateStudent extends Student  
- **Polymorphism:** Overridden `get_status()` method  
- **Encapsulation:** Internal handling of student/course data  

#### 📁 File Handling
- **CSV-based persistence:** Save and load data automatically  
- Store `students.csv`, `courses.csv`, and `enrollments.csv` for reuse  

#### ⚠️ Error Handling
- Input validation for all user entries  
- Graceful handling of missing or invalid data

### 🤝 Contribution  
This project was created purely for **learning and portfolio building**.  
If you'd like to suggest improvements or optimizations, feel free to **open an issue** or **submit a pull request**.

### 🔮 Next Steps  
This was my **first hands-on project** applying OOP, File Handling, and Error Handling together.  

Next, I plan to:
- Upgrade my **🛒 E-Commerce Order Insights** project by applying OOP-based modular design  
- Implement **class-based data models** and reusable file operations  
- Gradually evolve this into a **Database-backed Student System (SQLite or MySQL)**
