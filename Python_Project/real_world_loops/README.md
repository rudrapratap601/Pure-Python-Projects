### 🎯 Overview  
This folder contains **mini Python projects** that apply *loop logic* to solve real-world problems — from basic iteration to simple data analytics and text-based algorithms.  
Each project demonstrates how **fundamentals like loops, conditionals, and basic data structures** can be combined to perform meaningful computations — similar to what’s done in Data Science or AI workflows.

### 📂 Projects Included  

| Notebook | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Data_Normalization.ipynb** | Simulates how raw data can be normalized using loops — scales, cleans, and adjusts numeric ranges. |
| **Simple_Recommender.ipynb** | A rule-based recommendation system using for-loops to match users with relevant products. |
| **Word_Frequency_Counter.ipynb** | Counts word frequency in a paragraph or file — mimicking how NLP models preprocess data. |

---

### 🧠 Learning Outcomes  
- Applied Python loops to **real-world problem solving**  
- Strengthened data transformation and iteration logic  
- Practiced **pattern recognition and algorithmic thinking**  
- Simulated real data-processing logic used in analytics and ML  

---

### ⚡ Next Steps  
- Convert these scripts into **modular Python functions**  
- Add **file I/O** for reading real datasets  
- Extend `Word_Frequency_Counter` into a mini **text analytics** project  
- Upgrade `Simple_Recommender` with similarity metrics in the **ML version**
